# this is the small startup code that is first run when
# any executable that is statically-linked with Bionic
# runs.
#
# it's purpose is to call __libc_init with appropriate
# arguments, which are:
#
#    - the address of the raw data block setup by the Linux
#      kernel ELF loader
#
#    - address of an "onexit" function, not used on any
#      platform supported by Bionic
#
#    - address of the "main" function of the program.
#
#    - address of the constructor list
